This report is aimed to provide an insight into the recent global epidemic, Covid-19 data from CDC, dated between December 17th, 2020 to July 21st 2022. CDC has been collecting different Covid-19 related data across the US since the pandemic began and published most of these data for public access. In this report, we showed the process of curating the raw data from CDC to focus on a particular subset of covid-19 related data, for example, the Covid-19 positive test results data to create a growth chart. The growth chart depicts the proportion of Covid-19 positive test results for past seven days and how it changes per month over the two years. We have provided detail of the graph to explain what it depicts.
